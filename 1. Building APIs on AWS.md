# Interview Preparation Guide

## 1. Building APIs on AWS

### Key Topics:
- **AWS Lambda**: Understand how to create, deploy, and manage Lambda functions. Know how to handle different triggers (e.g., API Gateway, S3 events).
- **API Gateway**: Know how to create RESTful APIs using API Gateway, set up routes, methods, and integrate with Lambda functions.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Understand how to manage permissions and roles for Lambda functions and API Gateway.
- **KMS (Key Management Service)**: Know how to use KMS for encrypting sensitive data.
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Understand how to store and retrieve data from S3 buckets.
- **CloudFront**: Know how to use CloudFront for content delivery and caching.

### Example Questions:
- How do you create a RESTful API using API Gateway and Lambda?
- How do you secure your Lambda functions using IAM roles?
- How do you handle versioning and deployment of Lambda functions?
- How do you use KMS to encrypt data stored in S3?

## 2. Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Key Topics:
- **Unit Testing Frameworks**: Familiarize yourself with frameworks like Mocha, Chai, Jest, etc.
- **TDD**: Understand the principles of Test-Driven Development and how to write tests before code.
- **Mocking and Stubbing**: Know how to mock dependencies and external services in your tests.

### Example Questions:
- How do you write unit tests for a Node.js application?
- What is TDD and how do you implement it in your projects?
- How do you mock external HTTP requests in your tests?

## 3. RESTful Standards and API Documentation

### Key Topics:
- **RESTful Standards**: Understand the principles of REST, including statelessness, resource representation, and HTTP methods.
- **API Documentation**: Know how to document APIs using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Understand how to configure CORS in API Gateway and handle preflight requests.

### Example Questions:
- What are the key principles of RESTful APIs?
- How do you document your APIs using Swagger?
- How do you handle CORS issues in your APIs?

## 4. API Security

### Key Topics:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Understand how to generate, validate, and use JWTs for authentication and authorization.
- **OAuth 2.0**: Know the different grant types and how to implement OAuth 2.0 for securing APIs.
- **API Gateway Security**: Understand how to secure APIs using API Gateway features like API keys, usage plans, and Lambda authorizers.

### Example Questions:
- How do you implement JWT-based authentication in a Node.js API?
- What are the different OAuth 2.0 grant types and when would you use each?
- How do you secure your APIs using API Gateway?

## 5. Integrating SQL/NoSQL Databases and External Systems

### Key Topics:
- **SQL Databases**: Understand how to connect to and interact with SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) from a Node.js application.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Know how to work with NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).
- **External HTTP Systems**: Understand how to make HTTP requests to external systems and handle responses.

### Example Questions:
- How do you connect to a MySQL database from a Node.js application?
- What are the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?
- How do you handle external HTTP requests in your Node.js application?

## 6. Implementing APIs using Node.js

### Key Topics:
- **Express.js**: Familiarize yourself with building APIs using Express.js.
- **Middleware**: Understand how to use and create middleware in Express.js.
- **Error Handling**: Know how to handle errors in your APIs.

### Example Questions:
- How do you create a RESTful API using Express.js?
- How do you implement middleware in an Express.js application?
- How do you handle errors in your Node.js APIs?

## Final Tips

- **Review Documentation**: Make sure you are familiar with the official documentation for AWS services, Node.js, and any libraries you use.
- **Practice Coding**: Write code to solidify your understanding of the concepts.
- **Mock Interviews**: Practice with a friend or use online platforms to simulate the interview experience.
- **Stay Calm**: During the interview, take your time to understand the questions and think through your answers.

Good luck with your interview!
