A **Trie (Prefix Tree)** is a tree-like data structure used for efficiently storing and retrieving keys in a dataset of strings. Unlike binary search trees, in a Trie, nodes are not based on key comparisons. Instead, they store characters of a string, making it especially useful for scenarios involving text-based operations like searching for words, autocomplete, and spell-checking.

### Applications of Trie

1. **Autocomplete Systems**: Tries are ideal for implementing autocomplete, where based on a prefix entered by the user, the system suggests possible completions.
   
2. **Spell Checker**: Tries can be used for spell-checking by storing a dictionary and checking if words entered by the user exist in the dictionary.

3. **Search Engines**: Tries are used in search engines for indexing keywords so that relevant search results can be retrieved quickly.

4. **IP Routing (Longest Prefix Matching)**: Used in routers to store routing tables where each IP address is broken down into a series of prefixes for efficient searching.

5. **Word Games**: Games like Boggle or Scrabble where words need to be found based on prefixes can use a Trie for quick word validation.

6. **Text Prediction**: Mobile phones or software keyboards can implement a Trie to predict text based on user inputs.

7. **DNA Sequencing**: In bioinformatics, Tries can store DNA sequences and allow for quick matching of prefixes, which is crucial in certain genetic matching applications.
