## Here's an implementation of a simple hash table (or hash map) in JavaScript. This hash table will handle collisions using separate chaining, which stores multiple key-value pairs in a linked list at each index if they hash to the same index.

### [Hash Table Implementation:](./hash.js)

### Explanation:

1. **`_hash(key)`**:
   - A simple hash function that takes a string key and converts it into an index for the `buckets` array. It sums the character codes of the key and takes the modulus of the array size to ensure the index is within bounds.

2. **`set(key, value)`**:
   - This method inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists, it updates the value.
   - If a collision occurs (multiple keys hash to the same index), the value is stored in a linked list (represented as an array of arrays at the index).

3. **`get(key)`**:
   - Retrieves the value associated with the given key by first calculating its hash, then searching through the linked list (if there's more than one item).

4. **`remove(key)`**:
   - Deletes the key-value pair from the hash table.

5. **`display()`**:
   - Prints out the current state of the hash table, showing which buckets are filled.

This is a simple yet functional implementation of a hash table in JavaScript. The design can be improved with more sophisticated collision resolution techniques or by resizing the table when it's too full.
