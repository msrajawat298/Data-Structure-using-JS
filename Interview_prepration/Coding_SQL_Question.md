# SQL Query Challenges

### Create a two component one parent and one child. In child component Create input text box where user can enter the color name pass this color to parent component and change the background color of the body
### Read 3 json files, events.json, users.json, event-user.json
 - event { id, name, country, city, date } (given)
 - user {id, name, country, city} (given)
 - event-user (not given you you have to predict your schema what it should be? )
 - For a given date range - identify the users coming from different cities than event is hosted in.
 - Do using any programming and consider file is already import data in the 3 variables.
    - such as eventsData, usersData, eventUsers.
    - or for Sql you can consider there are three tables users, event, event_user

 - ***ANSWER*** 
    - Using Sql
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        e.id AS event_id,
        e.name AS event_name,
        e.city AS event_city,
        u.id AS user_id,
        u.name AS user_name,
        u.city AS user_city
    FROM 
        events e
    JOIN 
        event_user eu ON e.id = eu.event_id
    JOIN 
        users u ON eu.event_userId = u.id
    WHERE 
        e.date BETWEEN '2024-10-01' AND '2024-10-31' -- specify the date range here
        AND e.city != u.city;
    ```

### Problem 1: Get Flavors and Their Length (Asked in Cigna HealthCare)

### Problem Statement
Given a table named `Cakes` with the following columns:

- `Cake_Id` (int)
- `Flavor` (varchar)
- `Cost` (int)
- `Type` (varchar)

You are tasked with writing a query to:
1. Display the **Flavor** and the **length of the Flavor**.
2. Sort the results alphabetically by the **Flavor**.
3. Each flavor should only be displayed once.

### Input
The `Cakes` table contains the following sample data:

| Cake_Id | Flavor    | Cost | Type  |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| 1002    | Vanilla   | 20   | Cake  |
| 1003    | Chocolate | 15   | Cake  |
| 1004    | Varila    | 18   | Cake  |
| 1005    | Strawberry| 25   | Cake  |

### Output
Your query should return the flavor and its length, ordered alphabetically:

| Flavor     | FlavorLength |
|------------|--------------|
| Chocolate  | 9            |
| Strawberry | 10           |
| Vanilla    | 7            |
| Varila     | 6            |

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Flavor, LENGTH(Flavor) AS FlavorLength
FROM Cakes
ORDER BY Flavor;
```


### Problem 2: Concatenate Name and Age (Asked in Cigna HealthCare)

### Problem Statement
Given a table named `PersonalDetails` with the following columns:

- `Id` (int)
- `Name` (varchar)
- `Age` (int)
- `MaritalStatus` (varchar)

Write a query that concatenates the `Name` and `Age` columns with a space in between. Each person's information should be displayed as a single line.

### Input
The `PersonalDetails` table contains the following sample data:

| Id    | Name       | Age | MaritalStatus |
|-------|------------|-----|---------------|
| 1001  | Kyla       | 52  | Single        |
| 1002  | Elaine     | 70  | Married       |
| 1003  | MacKensie  | 71  | Divorced      |
| 1004  | Jermaine   | 42  | Single        |
| 1005  | Zahir      | 55  | Divorced      |
| 1006  | Xaviera    | 23  | Married       |
| 1007  | Yasir      | 47  | Married       |
| 1008  | Rebekah    | 60  | Single        |

### Output
The query should return a concatenated `Name` and `Age` for each person:

```
Kyla 52
Elaine 70
MacKensie 71
Jermaine 42
Zahir 55
Xaviera 23
Yasir 47
Rebekah 60
```

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(Name, ' ', Age) AS Name_Age
FROM PersonalDetails;
```

### Asked by Synup
User 
Account 
Folder 
Location 
Sub Location

One Account Can have multiple  folder 
One Folder Can have multiple Location 
One Location Can have multiple  Sub locations
One Account can have multiple users 
One User can have multiple Accounts
One Folder can have multiple users access
One User can have access to  multiple folder

Account have child folder and folder have child location and location have child location
Account Can have direct assigned Location without creating folder

Create a db schema in Postgres sql in such as way that user assigned to parent can see all child 
Lets account A1 is a parent and there are 3 child c1, c2, and c3 
If user have access of A1 then it can be access all child c1, c2 and c3 
But if user assigned to c1 only then it can only access c1 child only not c2 or c3 or other siblings but it can be know there parents such as A1 is there parents
User can be assigned directly to the location and sub location
If in c1 have 3 location l1, l2, l3 and each location have sub location sl1, sl2, sl3 
Then If user assigned l1 then it can only see there sub location not the siblings and if user assigned the direct sublocaion such as sl2 then it canâ€™t we access any other.



Create php rest api endpoint (getAllFoldersAndLocation by userID )that should return all details of location and sub-location
