- I Never Write Long Functions 
    - 1-2 line there it's ok to create separate function bcz each function define one logic or one responsibility only.
    - It's help lot's such as during writing unit test cases, understandable and maintainable.
- Trying to avoiding else or else if
- Trying to do early return
- Avoid writing more than 5 if. Writing more than 5-7 if worst case.
- Separate file for constant, logic and operational code part.
